      <p>
        These are referrals to KLRN's Passport donation page. Users who are not
        signed in as KLRN members are sent to the donation page after clicking a
        start-watching button. Daily referrals can also include referrals not
        associated with a video.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: PBS updates accidentally started dropping referral queries in
        summer 2024, but the issue was fixed in the first week of January 2024.
