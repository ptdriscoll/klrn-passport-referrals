      <p>
        These are referrals to KLRN's Passport donation page. Data comes from
        pages that users were on when a donation button was clicked. The Daily
        Referrals graph below can also include referrals not associated with a
        video or specific show.
      </p>

        NOTE: PBS updates accidentally started dropping referral queries in
        summer 2024, but the issue was fixed in the first week of January 2025.
